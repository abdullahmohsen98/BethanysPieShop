Building modern web applications using an ASP.NET Core 6 and ASP.NET Core 6 MVC

# Description
In this course, ASP.NET Core 6 Fundamentals, I will learn to build modern web applications using ASP.NET Core 6 and ASP.NET Core 6 MVC. First, explore the configuration of an ASP.NET Core 6 application based on middleware and dependency injection. Then, dive into building several new pages using the MVC pattern; create the view, and the controller, and connect with a database using a repository and Entity Framework Core 6. Next, you'll discover how an MVC site, server-side by default, can be enriched using ASP.NET Core Blazor and Ajax, combined with an ASP.NET Core API controller. Finally, I'll learn how to test the various components of an ASP.NET Core application with unit tests.
